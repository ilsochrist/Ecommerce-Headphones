# ECOMMERCE-HEADPHONES

This is a web and mobile application for e-commerce services. 

I used advanced React practices such as folder and file structure, hooks, and refs. Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API. Next.js practices such as file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation. And integrate integrate with Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process.
